      "Body": "\nHey Rich. Tell us a bit about yourself and what you do.\nHi! I\u2019m a freelance journalist and writer, originally from New Zealand. I\u2019ve spent the last couple of years traveling semi-permanently, writing about minimalism, saving money, and travel for various publications, and working on my own projects.\n\nWhat was your last regular job and how did you manage to leave the corporate world?\nI worked as a full-time business reporter for several years. It was a great job, but I was dying to see the world and free up time to pursue my own interests.\n\nAfter I started down the path of frugality and simple living, I managed to save up $100,000 by age 25.\n\nHitting that goal was the trigger to take what I originally thought might be a sabbatical of six months or so. Now it\u2019s been over two years, and there\u2019s still no end in sight! Kesarovska, L., 2022. How this guy saved $100k at 25, quit his job and traveled the world.

      "Body": "Who would have thought that after decades of struggle with procrastination, the dictionary, of all places, would hold the solution.\n\nAvoid procrastination. So elegant in its simplicity.\n\nWhile we\u2019re here, let\u2019s make sure obese people avoid overeating, depressed people avoid apathy, and someone please tell beached whales that they should avoid being out of the ocean.\n\nNo, \u201Cavoid procrastination\u201D is only good advice for fake procrastinators\u2014those people that are like, \u201CI totally go on Facebook a few times every day at work\u2014I\u2019m such a procrastinator!\u201D The same people that will say to a real procrastinator something like, \u201CJust don\u2019t procrastinate and you\u2019ll be fine.\u201D\n\nThe thing that neither the dictionary nor fake procrastinators understand is that for a real procrastinator, procrastination isn\u2019t optional\u2014it\u2019s something they don\u2019t know how to not do.\n\nIn college, the sudden unbridled personal freedom was a disaster for me\u2014I did nothing, ever, for any reason. The one exception was that I had to hand in papers from time to time. I would do those the night before, until I realized I could just do them through the night, and I did that until I realized I could actually start them in the early morning on the day they were due. This behavior reached caricature levels when I was unable to start writing my 90-page senior thesis until 72 hours before it was due, an experience that ended with me in the campus doctor\u2019s office learning that lack of blood sugar was the reason my hands had gone numb and curled up against my will.
